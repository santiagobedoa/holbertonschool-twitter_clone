## About the Developer üí¨

### Santiago Bedoya Arias

I'm a passionate backend developer looking to implement and launch cool projects. I have been trained in different programming languages such as C, Python, and Javascript, gaining excellent problem-solving skills. Also, I have knowledge in the most important areas of a business, such as marketing, finance, economics, business intelligence, and strategy. This means that I not only understand the business value of a process but also the workflow and coding relate to it. I have the ability to sit with a customer, understand their desires, target the problem, and participate in the coding process behind it.
